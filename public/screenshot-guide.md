## Promotional Images

- Simple, clean design with the ChroMarx logo
- Tagline: "Your AI Bookmark Assistant"
- Clean background with minimal distractions
- Use the blue and white color scheme from the app

### 2. Large Promotional Tile (920 x 680 pixels)
- Show the app interface with key features highlighted
- Include a brief feature list (3-4 bullet points)
- Keep text minimal and readable
- Focus on the AI organization aspect

### 3. Marquee Promotional Tile (1400 x 560 pixels)
- Wider format showing the app in context
- Include a browser frame to demonstrate the extension
- Show the seamless integration with Chrome
- Highlight cross-device sync with multiple device illustrations

## Image Quality Guidelines

- **Resolution**: All images should be crisp and clear with no pixelation
- **Text**: Any text in images should be readable and properly sized
- **Branding**: Include the ChroMarx logo and consistent color scheme
- **Content**: Use realistic bookmark data (nothing offensive or copyrighted)
- **Format**: Save as PNG with appropriate compression (aim for under 1MB per image)
- **Testing**: View images at actual size to ensure quality

## Example Creation Process

1. Set up a demo environment with realistic bookmark data
2. Configure the UI to show the most polished version of each feature
3. Use Chrome's built-in screenshot tool (or Snagit/Lightshot for more options)
4. Capture at the required dimensions or larger (can scale down)
5. Edit images to highlight key features with subtle indicators if needed
6. Add consistent borders and drop shadows if appropriate
7. Review all images for consistency in style and quality

## Additional Tips

- Capture in both light and dark modes to choose the most visually appealing
- Consider using browser mockups to show the extension in context
- Avoid overcrowding the images with too many features
- Focus on the main value proposition in each image
- Test how images look in the actual Chrome Web Store listing preview

## Promotional Video (Optional)

If creating a promotional video:
- Keep it under 60 seconds
- Focus on demonstrating actual usage
- Highlight the problem ChroMarx solves
- Show the most impressive AI features in action
- Include captions for accessibility
- Upload to YouTube and link in the store description

Remember that these images are often the first impression users will have of ChroMarx, so investing time in creating high-quality visuals is worthwhile.
