## Review Analysis Process

### Categorizing Feedback

All reviews should be categorized in our feedback tracking system:

1. **Bug reports**: Technical issues requiring fixes
2. **UI/UX feedback**: Comments on the user interface or experience
3. **Feature requests**: Suggestions for new functionality
4. **Performance issues**: Comments about speed, resource usage, etc.
5. **Positive feedback**: Compliments and satisfaction reports
6. **Pricing/value concerns**: Feedback about subscription model or pricing

### Prioritization Criteria

Use the following criteria to prioritize issues raised in reviews:

- **Frequency**: How many users are reporting the same issue?
- **Severity**: How seriously does it impact user experience?
- **Alignment**: Does addressing this align with our product roadmap?
- **Effort**: What's the estimated effort to implement or fix?
- **Impact**: What's the potential positive impact of addressing it?

## Follow-up Process

### Issue Resolution

1. Tag all reviews that report issues in our tracking system
2. Link reviews to corresponding issue tickets
3. When an issue is fixed, follow up with all users who reported it:

```
